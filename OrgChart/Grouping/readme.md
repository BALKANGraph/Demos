# Grouping 
OrgChart JS supports Grouping of nodes.  Most organizations group departments by function—e.g. marketing, HR, sales, etc.—but you could also group by product for larger companies or physical location for international companies.

Putting multiple nodes into one box saves a considerable amount of space compared with assigning each node their own box.
